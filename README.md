# Coding-Duet


It really wasn't hard making my hair website for my client Chrystal, but I am happy that we had enough time to complete and make a finished website.  -Destiny Gross



I wish that we had more time to complete the project to make it better. My client is actually my partner's mom and she owns a hair salon and we think it'll be nice to make a website for her to expand her business. Another thing is that it was hard to keep going back and changing the code, but I really enjoyed making progress every week on my website.   -Essence Emerick



Three images were not showing up because we left off .jpg after them.  It worked fine in Treehouse without .jpg after them, but not after being published in GitHub.  This was corrected (4-9-17).
